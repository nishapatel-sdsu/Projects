Assignemnt
There are 8 programs overall. Two programs are written in four different languages i.e C++, C, Pascal and Fortran

Below is the information about the IDE and the compiler used to write, run and test the programs.
The programs typically take a input file called input.txt. The output is written in the ouput file called output.txt.

Input.txt
For C , C++ and Pascal  programs the input file list one array value on each line. The two array are seperated by a space or empty line. The trget value is written at the end after the second array 
precedded by a empty space.

For Fortran program the delimiter between the first and second array values is -1 instead of a space. Also the target value is seperated by -1 after the second array values.
